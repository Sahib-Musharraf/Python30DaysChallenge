Hi I am Sahib, I am taking 30 days python challenge
The Last Leaf

In a quiet, cobblestone neighborhood of an old city lived two young women, Sue and Johnsy, both artists sharing a small apartment. One winter, Johnsy fell gravely ill with pneumonia. She lay in bed, barely speaking, staring out the window at the vine creeping along the brick wall of the building next door.

As the leaves on the vine fell one by one, Johnsy grew more hopeless. She whispered to Sue, “When the last leaf falls, I will go too.”

Sue, heartbroken but determined, tried to convince her that life was worth living, but Johnsy only stared at the shrinking vine. Their elderly neighbor, Behrman, a gruff but kind old painter, overheard Sue one day. He had always dreamed of painting a masterpiece but never had.

That night, during a storm, the last leaf on the vine should have fallen. But the next morning, when Johnsy opened her eyes, the leaf was still there. Day after day, it clung on—green, unwavering.

Moved by its resilience, Johnsy began to recover. She told Sue, “That leaf has taught me that I must not give up.”

What she didn’t know was that Behrman, who had finally painted his masterpiece—a perfect leaf—had done so that night in the freezing rain. He caught pneumonia and passed away days later, but not before saving Johnsy’s life.
