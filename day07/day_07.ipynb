    "# File handling refers to the process of creating, opening, reading, writing, and closing files using programming.\n",
    "# In Python, file handling is done using built-in functions like open(), read(), write(), and close().\n",
    "# \n",
    "# Common steps in file handling:\n",
    "# 1. Opening a file: Use open('filename', 'mode') to get a file object. Modes include 'r' (read), 'w' (write), 'a' (append), etc.\n",
    "# 2. Reading from a file: Use methods like read(), readline(), or readlines() to get data from the file.\n",
    "# 3. Writing to a file: Use write() or writelines() to add data to the file.\n",
    "# 4. Closing a file: Use close() to free up system resources.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# It's recommended to use the 'with' statement for file handling, as it automatically closes the file after the block is executed.\n",

    "## Example and Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "### Approach\n",
    "1. **Open a file** using the `open()` function with the desired mode (`'r'` for reading, `'w'` for writing, etc.).\n",
    "2. **Read from or write to the file** using methods like `read()`, `write()`, or `readlines()`.\n",
    "3. **Close the file** using `close()`, or use a `with` statement to handle closing automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Writing to a file\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'w') as file:\n",
    "    file.write('This is an example of file handling in Python.')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reading from a file\n",
    "with open('sample.txt', 'r') as file:\n",
    "    content = file.read()\n",
    "    print(content)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the `with` statement is recommended as it ensures the file is properly closed after its suite finishes, even if an exception is raised."
